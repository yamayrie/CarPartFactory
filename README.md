# Project 2 - Car Part Factory

## Introduction
Project for the Data Structures class. Created a simulator for a car part factory.

## Features

- **Machine Simulation** - Simulates different machines with timers, conveyor belts, weight variation, defective parts, and the production of car parts.

- **Factory management** - Has methods to set up machines, process orders, run the factory simulator, and generate a report.

## Class Structure

To efficiently store the car parts, a DoublyLinkedList was used. With this choice, it allows us to smoothly add and remove. It allows us to traverse with efficiency and with improved time complexity than using an ArrayList.
